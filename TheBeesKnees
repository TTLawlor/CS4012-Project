    <p>The knee of the bee, more commonly known as the bee’s knees are an essential part of a bees anatomy.
        Most commonly used as a phrase to describe something as being the best of quality, the bee’s knees
        truly live up to their legacy. </p>

    <p>According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to
        get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans
        think is impossible. Bees have knees, knees that contain herculean like strength and power. A bee’s take off has
        a velocity comparable to the force of splitting an atom. This wouldn’t be possible without the efficient
        machine-like inner workings of the bee’s hinge joints, ligaments, cartilage and tissue. The bee’s knees are
        special and need to be protected at all costs.</p>

    <p>The lose of the bees would mean the loss of the worlds greatest marvel in sheer power and the defiance of
        gravity. You can do your part. Implementing <a class= "link" href="https://www.vita-europe.com/beehealth/products/bee-gym/"> in hive gyms</a>
        We want to make sure that no bee is ever forced to skip leg day again, keeping the bee’s knees healthy and
        functioning correctly. We have the biggest experts in the fitness of bees in our team, working alongside our

        Our Bee Gyms cost thousands to make as well as using up a huge amount of man hours. The state of the art gyms
        can not be made possible without the support of the general public. The Bees get their pump in using various
        types of weight training methods. They have free weights and dumbbells specifically designed to enhance bee
        performance and endurance in the toughest conditions a bee can find themselves in. The bees knees need to be
        extensively trained and cared for without any hindrance or outside interference, therefore these gyms are
        extensively soundproofed to avoid distractions from the outside world. Bees need the best, and we want to
        provide the best. But we cant provide these necessary additiions to a hive without your donations. Please
        consider donating to our cause and help fight back agaisnt the decline in bee population and the loss of these
        beautiful and swole creatures.
